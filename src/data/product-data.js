        "Nike Air is our iconic innovation that uses pressurized air in a durable, flexible membrane to provide lightweight cushioning. The air compresses on impact and then immediately returns to its original shape and volume, ready for the next impact. We debuted Nike Air in 1979, and we've been continuously evolving and improving it ever since.",
